# Hardware
The Honors College uses several types of hardware to provide a seamless computing experience to its faculty, staff and students

## Servers
We use two Mac Mini 5,1 headless computers with Core i5 processors and 16 GB of RAM, one at the MD Anderson Library and one at the Honors Gardens. 

### Storage
We use a Synology DS415+ NAS device with 24 TB of storage in a RAID 5 to provide network backup and file services.

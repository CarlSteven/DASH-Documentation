The Honors College opens at 8 AM during the week. The classroom computers and computer lab need to be checked for readiness at the start of each day. This process should be started about 45 minutes before classes start (ask SSO what time the first class of the day is). This will give you time to fix anything that is not working.

## Classroom Computers
The classroom computers should be checked to make sure they're ready for classes. Verify that these computers turn on, login to the guest account, and mirror their displays to the classroom projector. If any update dialog boxes appear (Software Update, Flash, etc.), install the updates and make sure the computer restarts correctly.

## Computer Lab
The computer lab is used fairly heavily during Honors College business hours. Make sure that all of the printer paper trays have paper and that the printers are not displaying any errors. If we are running low on paper, let the Business Office know so that they can place an order.

## Printers
Make sure that all the other printers in the space (including the copiers) have paper and are not displaying any errors.

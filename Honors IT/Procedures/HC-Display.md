The slideshow playing at the display in the entrance area is simply a PowerPoint slideshow.
Someone from the Communications Department will provide the PowerPoint Slideshow and should store in the shared drive (UHSA1).
To switch out the slideshow:
1. Access HC-Display via Apple Remote Desktop. (The actual HC-Display computer is running on a Mac Mini in SSO)
2. Open Finder and go to shared drive. (It should be already connected as uhsa1.cougarnet.uh.edu) Go to a folder called "Digital Signage")
3. Copy the PowerPoint file onto the Desktop.
4. Start the the PowerPoint as Slide Show -> Play from Start.

The Honors College uses several types of hardware to provide a seamless computing experience to its faculty, staff and students.

## Servers

We use two Mac Mini 5.1 headless computers with Core i5 processors and 16 GB of RAM, one at the MD Anderson Library and one at the Honors Gardens.

## Storage

We use a [Synology DS415+](https://www.synology.com/en-global/products/DS415+) NAS device with 24 TB of storage in a RAID 5 to provide network backup and file services. Documentation is attached below. The configuration interface can be reached at http://hc-storage.cougarnet.uh.edu:5000/

## Computers

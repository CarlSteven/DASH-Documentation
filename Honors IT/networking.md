##Honors Gardens

###Subnets
172.27.218.*

172.27.219.*

###Network Speed
100 Mbps

###Special Information 
The Honors Gardens has two different subnets, which presents some difficulties when attempting to netboot from a deployment server. In addition, when looking for computers using remote desktop, scans must be done on each subnet individually.

##Activating Network Jacks

Most rooms only have one network jack activated. However, one can file a work order with UH IT at ```http://uh.edu/infotech```. They require the number of the jack, so make a note of it before going to file the request.

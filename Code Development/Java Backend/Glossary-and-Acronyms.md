IoC - Inversion of Control, synonymous with Dependency Injection

DI - Dependency Injection, the Spring the process where objects define their dependencies only through constructor arguments, arguments to a factory method, or properties that are set on the object instance after it is constructed or returned from a factory. These dependencies are inject into the bean when it is created. This is know as Inversion of Control because it is fundamentally the opposite of traditional control, where the bean itself controls the instantiation of its dependencies.

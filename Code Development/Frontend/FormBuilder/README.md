FormBuilder
===

FormBuilder allows users to dynamically generate, respond to, and process responses to forms. FormBuilder is the portion of the application that is deployed to the online website, it is not intended to run in a mobile environment.

It is built from the [angular-form-builder](https://github.com/kelp404/angular-form-builder) and therefore the internal structure and workings of the module can be difficult to work with as they not well documented and are written in CoffeeScript.

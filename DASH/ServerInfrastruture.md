DASH is using a couple of virtual servers that are hosted on one server housed inside the RCC.

Here is the list virtual servers:

| Name    | DNS Name   | IP Address                 |
|-----------------|--------------|---------------------------|
| hnetdev     | hnetdev.hnet.uh.edu | 129.7.54.56 |


All the virtual servers are running RedHat Enterprise Linux 7 (RHEL 7). There is a firewall on each server which is using [FirewallD](http://www.certdepot.net/rhel7-get-started-firewalld/).
